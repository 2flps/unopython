# Uno Python

:warning: **WORK IN PROGRESS!** :warning:

A Uno game made in Python. In the actual state the game is only in Portuguese, although the commentaries are in English. If you know Uno's rules and you don't speak Portuguese, you will find no troubles playing the game. (Just some words you might have to translate)

## Rules
Check out [this article made by Ultra Board Games](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/uno/game-rules.php) explaining how to play Uno. Just be aware that there is no Blank Card and "scoring system" in this version.

## Playing the game
To play the game you just need to put the three Python files inside a folder and execute "jogo.py". A new file called "config.ini" will be generated inside the folder. With this file you will be able to change the game's configuration.
